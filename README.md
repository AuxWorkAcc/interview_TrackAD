All TODO's done, explanatory comments are added, migrations completed and requirements for the backend api are provided at .\public\js\product\components\ProductCreate.vue starting at 41 line.

Improvements:

1. added error and loading state to store
2. added lazy loading of components to main.js
3. added error and loading management indication in components
4. added deboucing from lodash to the ProductTable search


Further improvements:

It may be bernefitial to add pagination to products list if it is expected to be big, because of the fact that we using dummy api here I cannot forsee limit query structure, thus pagination improvement not been implemented.


Challenges: because project contains mainly basic functionality, no major challenges been faced
